## 🔗 How It Works?

At Tulobyte, we believe true value should come from within a system — not from thin air. Here's how our ecosystem is structured:

- **💰 Total Supply:**  A fixed supply of **20 billion TBYT tokens** has been generated.

- **🔒 Platform-Bound Access:**  Tokens **cannot be withdrawn** from the platform directly. The only way to extract value is through **staking**.

- **🛠️ Developer Allocation:**  A **small allocation** is reserved for the development team to **initiate mining** and support early ecosystem activities.

- **⏳ Hold to Earn:**  Users who **acquire and hold** TBYT over time are **rewarded** for their loyalty through our built-in holding rewards mechanism.

- **⛏️ Finite Mining:**  Once all tokens have been mined, **no additional TBYT** will be created.

- **📈 Exchange Launch:**  After mining completion, TBYT will be **listed on exchanges** for open trading.
